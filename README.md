# Circadian Rhythm and Cell Growth
Study of the impact of internal body rhythms on cell growth using computational models and experiments from single-cell to populational level. 
These findings illuminate the intricate interplay between circadian rhythms, cellular signaling, and tissue physiology, enhancing our understanding of tissue homeostasis and growth regulation in both health and disease contexts.
